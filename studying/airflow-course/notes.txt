Introduction

**1-Why we need data orchestration?**

Imagine that you have a basic pipeline: Extract -> Clean -> Transform -> Load

Once that clean phase fail, the dependencies (transform and load) will stop

So, you have to check the log and fix the error manually

With data orchestration, check and restart the dependencie that fail, are automatically. This is what Airflow do.
In real world, you will managing a lot of pipelines. So, do this automatically is a time saver
